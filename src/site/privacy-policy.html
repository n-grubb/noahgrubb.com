        <h1>Privacy Policy for Noah's Personal Finance App</h1>
        <p>I'm building a personal finance app for my household to manage our finances. In order to do so, I will leverage financial data providers to automatically import transactions. This policy details how the data will be levarged by the app.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal Information is never sold or rented, to any party, for any reason, at any time.</li>
            <li>The personal finance app leverages partners with strong security backgrounds to source data: Stripe and Apple. Those parties will hold your account information, the app will keep copies of customized data within a user's iCloud account.</li>
            <li>Data can be deleted at any time. A user who chooses to delete their data will have all data permanently removed within the app.</li>
            <li>Contact Noah if you have any futher questions.</li>
        </ul>

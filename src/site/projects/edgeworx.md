### Project Overview:

Edgeworx is an Eclipse-backed startup that created a platform for edge computing. I developed their brochure site and contributed to the development of the documentation site for their platform ioFog. I worked with a very talented UI/UX designer, <a href="https://www.anamedina.design" target="_blank">Ana Medina</a>, on this project and was tasked with bringing her designs to life. 

<h3><span>Challenge:</span>Propreitary CMS</h3>

The major challenge of this project was utilizing a completely custom PHP-based content management system written by the company's founder, Kilton. I worked with Kilton to flesh out more of the CMS' features as we built the Edgeworx site.

<h3><span>Challenge:</span>Microservices Slider</h3>

To add some wow-factor to the site, I was responsible for adding an interactive slider to display microservices that could be used with Edgeworx. The microservices were setup within the custom CMS. When a user hovers over a microservice, the slider must pause so that the box can be more easily read. This was a fun animation challenge to tackle and I'm very happy with the end result.

<h3><span>Challenge:</span>Documentation Site</h3>

I also had the privelege of working with the team at <a href="https://www.thisdot.co/" target="_blank">This Dot</a> to create a documentation site for the ioFog application. We wanted to use Markup to write the documentation since this project is open-source and other developers will need to contribute to the documentation as well. We saw this as a great opportunity to give <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/" target="_blank">Gatsby</a> a try. Using Gatsby, we created the brochure portion of the site and combined it with the markup driven documenation resource.

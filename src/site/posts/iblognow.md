Today, I have launched this new blog & personal site. I plan to use this site as an outlet to share cool stuff I've done, cool stuff I've found, my webdev experiments and, of course, my opinions (which I have no shortage of). 

This site is built with <a href="https://www.11ty.io" target="_blank" title="Eleventy">Eleventy</a> and hosted via <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank" title="Netlify">Netlify</a>.
